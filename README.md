# Sorting Algorithm Races with GUI

This is a fun and educational project that visualizes sorting algorithms in a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt. It is an enhanced version of the **sorting_algorithm_races** project, but with an added GUI. The project is designed to run in **Visual Studio 2022** and uses **Qt** for the graphical interface.

## Features
- **Visualization of sorting algorithms**: Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Stable Sort.
- **Real-time animation**: Sorting progress is displayed in real time as columns are rearranged.
- **Adjustable sorting speed**: Use a slider to control the speed of the sorting animation.
- **Reset functionality**: Easily reset and regenerate the data set to visualize the sorting process again.
- **Improved visibility**: Red marker added for currently checked element.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Qt Widgets** for GUI elements (QSlider, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout).
- **C++ and QtConcurrent** for handling sorting algorithms and updating the UI concurrently.
- **Visual Studio 2022** as the development environment.

## To Do
1. Implement pause and resume functionality for sorting.

## How to Run
1. Clone the project.
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2022**.
3. Make sure you have **Qt** installed and properly set up with Visual Studio.
4. Build and run the project to see the sorting algorithms in action.
